Emails should be written and read in the dark. May the dark be kinder on thine eyes. (ProtonMail dark theme)

This is a dark theme for ProtonMail inspired by [FT DeepDark](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ft-deepdark/?src=search). 

Also, credit where credit is due for the color palettes down bellow. ([@KDE](https://github.com/KDE), [@horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180), [@linuxmint](https://github.com/linuxmint), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/))

### Using the ProtonMail settings
  >~~This cannot be imported so you will have to copy the code from [here](https://gitlab.com/RaitaroH/ProtonMail-DeepDark/raw/master/ProtonMailDeepDark.user.css).~~  
  >~~If is too long, delete everything until you get to `@moz`. If even that is too much, delete everything in between `/**/` inside `:root`.~~  
  >~~Also **DO NOT** forget to replace the variables in `:root` (`/*[[mainColor]]*/` this stuff) with a set I provide just bellow `--shadow` for the theme to actually work.~~
